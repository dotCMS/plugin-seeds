# README

This bundle plugin is an example of how to Schedule Quartz Jobs using an OSGI bundle plugin.  It is an important example because it also demonstrates how to inject classes from your bundle into the running dotCMS instance.  The plugin activator has two methods that add and remove the class definitions to and from the dotCMS class loader. This is important because Quartz needs cleanly instantiate the Job and Test classes when it runs in the dotCMS context - outside of the bundle. 

## How to build this example

To build the JAR, run the following Maven command: 
```sh
mvn clean install
```

This will generate the plugin JAR in the `target` directory.

## How to install this bundle

* **To install this bundle:**

  Copy the bundle JAR file inside the Felix OSGI container (`dotCMS/felix/load`).

  OR

  Upload the bundle JAR file using the dotCMS UI (`CMS Admin -> Plugins -> Upload Plugin`).

* **To uninstall this bundle:**

  Remove the bundle JAR file from the Felix OSGI container (`dotCMS/felix/load`).

  OR

  Undeploy the bundle JAR using the dotCMS UI (`CMS Admin -> Plugins -> Undeploy`).

## How to create a bundle plugin for Annotation Framework based on AOP  

In order to create this OSGI plugin, Maven is configured to generate the `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file automatically. If needed, you can customize the configuration in the `pom.xml`.

Below is a description of the required fields in the `MANIFEST.MF` and how they are configured in a `pom.xml`:

> **Bundle-Name:** The name of your bundle  
> **Bundle-SymbolicName:** A short and unique name for the bundle  
> **Bundle-Vendor:** The vendor of the bundle (example: dotCMS)  
> **Bundle-Description:** A brief description of the bundle  
> **Bundle-DocURL:** URL for the bundle documentation  
> **Bundle-Activator:** Package and name of your Activator class (example: com.dotmarketing.osgi.actionlet.Activator)  
> **Export-Package:** Declares the packages that are visible outside the plugin. Any package not declared here has visibility only within the bundle.  
> **Import-Package:** This is a comma-separated list of the names of packages to import. This list must include the packages that you are using inside your OSGI bundle plugin and are exported and exposed by the dotCMS runtime.

These fields are configured in the `pom.xml` as follows:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.felix</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-bundle-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>5.1.9</version>
    <extensions>true</extensions>
    <configuration>
        <instructions>
            <Bundle-Name>Your Bundle Name</Bundle-Name>
            <Bundle-SymbolicName>com.example.yourbundle</Bundle-SymbolicName>
            <Bundle-Vendor>dotCMS</Bundle-Vendor>
            <Bundle-Description>dotCMS - OSGI Actionlet example</Bundle-Description>
            <Bundle-DocURL>https://dotcms.com/</Bundle-DocURL>
            <Bundle-Activator>com.dotmarketing.osgi.actionlet.Activator</Bundle-Activator>
            <Export-Package>com.example.yourbundle.package</Export-Package>
            <Import-Package>*</Import-Package>
        </instructions>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

## Beware (!)

In order to work inside the Apache Felix OSGI runtime, the import and export directives must be bidirectional:

* **Exported Packages**

  The dotCMS must declare the set of packages that will be available to the OSGI plugins by updating the file: `dotCMS/WEB-INF/felix/osgi-extra.conf`.
  This can also be configured using the dotCMS UI (`CMS Admin -> Plugins -> Exported Packages`).

  Only after the exported packages are defined in this list, can a plugin import the packages to use them inside the OSGI bundle.

* **Fragment (Deprecated)**

  Previously, a bundle fragment was used to make its contents available to other bundles by exporting 3rd party libraries from dotCMS. Fragments do not participate in the lifecycle of the bundle and therefore cannot have a Bundle-Activator. As this is no longer required, this section is deprecated.

## Components

### com.dotmarketing.osgi.job.CustomJob

Simple Job class that implements the regular Quartz Job interface

### Activator

This bundle activator extends from *com.dotmarketing.osgi.GenericBundleActivator* and implements *BundleActivator.start()*.
Will manually register a *CronScheduledTask* making use of the method *scheduleQuartzJob*

* PLEASE note the *unregisterServices()* call on the *stop* method, this call is MANDATORY (!) as it will allow us to stop and
remove the register Quartz Job when the plugin is undeploy.

# Limitations (!)

There are limitations on the hot deploy functionality for the OSGI Quartz Job plugin, once you upload this plugin you are limited
on what code you can modify for the Quartz Job classes in order to see those changes the next time you upload the plugin.

This will apply only for the OSGI Quartz plugins, exactly to the Quartz Job class you implement and the classes use it by it, because
in order to integrate this plugin with the dotCMS/Quartz code we are using our plugin code outside the OSGI and the plugin context,
trying to let know to dotCMS/Quartz that there is a Job outside its classpath trying to be use it and instantiate by them.

In order to support the use of the Quartz Jobs inside ours OSGI plugins we use the java hot swapping, it allows to redefine classes,
unfortunately, this redefinition is limited only to changing method bodies:

> The redefinition may change method bodies, the constant pool and attributes. The redefinition must not add, remove or rename fields or methods, change the signatures of methods, or change inheritance.

As long as you don't add, remove or change methods (ONLY the methods bodies) for your Job code you will have an OSGI plugin that
will reflect you changes when a redeploy is done. If you need to change the signature of the Job classes a restart of the dotCMS app will be require.
