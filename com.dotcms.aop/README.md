# README
This is an example of how to create and load Jersey Based REST resources in dotCMS via OSGi and Annotation Framework based on AOP 

On the pom.xml you can see the necessary configuration to apply our aspects on your plugin in order to be able to use 
the annotations in your project; currently dotCMS is using aspectjs as an AOP provider and compile-time injection for aspects.

In this example you can see how to use three annotations:

#### LogTime
Any method annotated with this annotation will log (if the appender is enable) the time needed to execute the method.

#### CloseDBIfOpened
This annotation will close open connections in the thread local, in addition to any hibernate session, fully recommended to use on API or Services that calls persistence components.

#### WrapInTransaction
This annotation will handle a local transaction for you (if needed, it can handle nested transaction too).
It will provide an appropiate connection, if needed and handle the commit, rollback or close resources depending on the execution of the method.

## How to build this example

To build the JAR, run the following Maven command: 
```sh
mvn clean install
```

This will generate the plugin JAR in the `target` directory.

## How to install this bundle

* **To install this bundle:**

  Copy the bundle JAR file inside the Felix OSGI container (`dotCMS/felix/load`).

  OR

  Upload the bundle JAR file using the dotCMS UI (`CMS Admin -> Plugins -> Upload Plugin`).

* **To uninstall this bundle:**

  Remove the bundle JAR file from the Felix OSGI container (`dotCMS/felix/load`).

  OR

  Undeploy the bundle JAR using the dotCMS UI (`CMS Admin -> Plugins -> Undeploy`).

## How to create a bundle plugin for Annotation Framework based on AOP  

In order to create this OSGI plugin, Maven is configured to generate the `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file automatically. If needed, you can customize the configuration in the `pom.xml`.

Below is a description of the required fields in the `MANIFEST.MF` and how they are configured in a `pom.xml`:

> **Bundle-Name:** The name of your bundle  
> **Bundle-SymbolicName:** A short and unique name for the bundle  
> **Bundle-Vendor:** The vendor of the bundle (example: dotCMS)  
> **Bundle-Description:** A brief description of the bundle  
> **Bundle-DocURL:** URL for the bundle documentation  
> **Bundle-Activator:** Package and name of your Activator class (example: com.dotmarketing.osgi.actionlet.Activator)  
> **Export-Package:** Declares the packages that are visible outside the plugin. Any package not declared here has visibility only within the bundle.  
> **Import-Package:** This is a comma-separated list of the names of packages to import. This list must include the packages that you are using inside your OSGI bundle plugin and are exported and exposed by the dotCMS runtime.

These fields are configured in the `pom.xml` as follows:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.felix</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-bundle-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>5.1.9</version>
    <extensions>true</extensions>
    <configuration>
        <instructions>
            <Bundle-Name>Your Bundle Name</Bundle-Name>
            <Bundle-SymbolicName>com.example.yourbundle</Bundle-SymbolicName>
            <Bundle-Vendor>dotCMS</Bundle-Vendor>
            <Bundle-Description>dotCMS - OSGI Actionlet example</Bundle-Description>
            <Bundle-DocURL>https://dotcms.com/</Bundle-DocURL>
            <Bundle-Activator>com.dotmarketing.osgi.actionlet.Activator</Bundle-Activator>
            <Export-Package>com.example.yourbundle.package</Export-Package>
            <Import-Package>*</Import-Package>
        </instructions>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

## Beware (!)

In order to work inside the Apache Felix OSGI runtime, the import and export directives must be bidirectional:

* **Exported Packages**

  The dotCMS must declare the set of packages that will be available to the OSGI plugins by updating the file: `dotCMS/WEB-INF/felix/osgi-extra.conf`.
  This can also be configured using the dotCMS UI (`CMS Admin -> Plugins -> Exported Packages`).

  Only after the exported packages are defined in this list, can a plugin import the packages to use them inside the OSGI bundle.

* **Fragment (Deprecated)**

  Previously, a bundle fragment was used to make its contents available to other bundles by exporting 3rd party libraries from dotCMS. Fragments do not participate in the lifecycle of the bundle and therefore cannot have a Bundle-Activator. As this is no longer required, this section is deprecated.

## How to test

Once installed, you can access by get this resource by (this assumes you are on localhost)

`http://localhost:8080/api/v1/custom/content/inode/006de26b-376c-495a-9f7d-913a578b033d`

or this by delete, which requires an dotcms user to access(See authentication below)

**Note: keep in mind this resources will delete last month content!**

`http://localhost:8080/api/v1/custom/content/lastMonth`

## Authentication

This API supports the same REST auth infrastructure as other 
rest apis in dotcms. There are 4 ways to authenticate.

* user/xxx/password/yyy in the URI
* basic http/https authentication (base64 encoded)
* DOTAUTH header similar to basic auth and base64 encoded, e.g. setHeader("DOTAUTH", base64.encode("admin@dotcms.com:admin"))
* Session based (form based login) for frontend or backend logged in user
* JWT
